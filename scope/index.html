    <h1>This is tied for the second most important part of long range shooting.</h1>
    <h2>A good scope gives you one of the most important tools needed to reach a long distance.</h2>
    <div>You want a scope that is clear out to the distance you are shooting at.</div>
    <div>You will want it to have an adjustable paralax to help focus it at other ranges as well.</div>
    <div>It needs to have an adjustable view to reach out and see at further distances.</div>
    <div>You will also want good eye relief so you can keep yourself at a comfortable distance from the scope.</div>
    <div>Another important part is knowing your scope so you can make windage and elevation adjustments.</div>
    <div><em>A good scope can help you put precise shots and make you a long range shooter.</em></div>
