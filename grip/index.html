    <h1>Not as important as breathing but still important for long range shooting.</h1>
    <h2>Grip is important.</h2>
    <div>Having a grip thats not to tight or to light.</div>
    <div>You want to have a grip that is comfortable but still firm to stay on target.</div>
    <div>If it's to tight you will pull of target and you will miss your mark.</div>
    <div>If it's to light you will go off target as soon as you fire cause you won't be held on your target well.</div>
    <div><em>If your grip is just right you will have zero problems and hit your mark.</em></div>
