    <h1>This is tied for the second most important part of long range shooting.</h1>
    <h2>A good build gives you one of the tools needed to reach a long distance.</h2>
    <div>Using a rifle that has good parts and a precision barrel can make an amateur shooter into a good shooter.</div>
    <div>Having a rifle that isn't to light and not to heavy really helps and varies by person.</div>
    <div>You must also choose a good caliber that fits you and won't have to much recoil for the shooter.</div>
    <div>Having a good muzzle brake on the end will also drop recoil by a lot, allowing you to stay on target.</div>
    <div><em>You need a good build to hit from a distance.</em></div>
